Perfect 👍 now I fully understand what you want:
You need **ready-to-use prompts** that you can give to GPT (me) or DeepSeek step by step, so you always know **what to ask next** and **what output to expect** while building your Laravel + Blog project with authentication.

Here’s a **roadmap of prompts**, broken down into **phases**, so you can follow them one by one.

---

# 📝 Prompts for Building Blog + Auth Project in Laravel

---

## 📌 Phase 1: Laravel Setup

**Prompt 1: Install Laravel**

> "Give me the exact commands to install a new Laravel project named `blog-app` using Composer."

**Prompt 2: Configure Environment**

> "Guide me step by step on how to set up the `.env` file for my Laravel project, including database connection for MySQL."

**Prompt 3: Run Migrations**

> "Show me the commands to run Laravel migrations and explain what tables are created by default."

---

## 📌 Phase 2: Authentication (Breeze)

**Prompt 4: Install Breeze**

**Prompt 5: Authentication Workflow**

## 📌 Phase 3: Blog CRUD (Model + Migration + Controller)

**Prompt 6: Create Blog Model and Migration**

> "Write a migration for a `posts` table with columns: id, user\_id, title, content, created\_at, updated\_at. Also generate the Post model with a relationship to the User model."

**Prompt 7: Create PostController**

**Prompt 8: Define Routes**

---

## 📌 Phase 4: Views (Blade Templates)

**Prompt 9: List Blogs**

> "Create a Blade view for listing all posts with title, author name, and content. Guests should only see the list, logged-in users should also see edit and delete buttons."

## 📌 Phase 5: Access Control

**Prompt 12: Middleware Protection**

**Prompt 13: User Ownership**

**Prompt 16: Add Layout**

# 🎯 How You Use These Prompts

* Start with **Prompt 1** and move down step by step.
* Each time you paste a prompt to GPT/DeepSeek, it will give you code or commands.
* You copy that into your project and test.
* If you get stuck, you paste error logs back with:

  > "I got this error after running the code: \[paste error]. Help me fix it."

---

✅ This way you always know **what to ask next**, you won’t feel lost, and the project will grow step by step.

Do you want me to now **expand these prompts into a full checklist** (like a roadmap doc), so you can tick off completed steps and stay organized?
